# Intro_to_Data_Science_Applied_Machine_Learning

## Project: Apply machine learning to your capstone project
You've collected your data, cleaned it up, wrangled it into shape and explored it. Now it's time to perform some in-depth data analysis using machine learning. This step depends on you and your mentor, but here are some suggestions to get you going.

1. How do you frame your main question as a machine learning problem? Is it a supervised or unsupervised problem? If it is supervised, is it a regression or a classification?

2. What are the main features (also called independent variables or predictors) that you'll use?

3. Which machine learning technique will you use?

4. How will you evaluate the success of your machine learning technique? What metric will you use?

## Submission

1. Summarize your answers to the questions above in a short (1-2 page max) document. You may use any format of your choice (R Markdown, Google Docs, Word etc).

2. Add this document to the github repository for your project.

3. Submit a link to this document.

This document will be incorporated into your final project report.
